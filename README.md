# Reinforcement-learning-for-stabilising-double-inverted-pendulum1
This is a final project of Reinforcement learning course at skoltech which is devoted for stabilising double inverted pendulum


Kovalev.V.V

### We pursued several problems:
* stabilizing cart pole with the horizontal axis, when initstate  = $[0,\pi / 2 + \sigma,\pi / 2 + \sigma,0,0,0]$
* force the swing up of pendulum
### We'v applemented Dinamics of system on Casadi, constructed environmet, run it all on the methods bellow: 
*  MPC
*  PPO
*  ...
### You may see gif results in the corresponding folders
